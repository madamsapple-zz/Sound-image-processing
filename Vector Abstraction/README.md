This is project "faces" for the Vector abstraction brief.

## Operation
Simply the run the .pde file in processing.

## Description
I made a semblance of a face here after taking inspiration from Antonio Saura's "24 heads" artwork (https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/the-collection/works/24-heads). I liked the idea of somewhat abstract polygon shapes representing the illusion of a human face. The artist uses certain patterns such as white and black background (for face and eyes), squiggly lines for teeth and eyebrows, sticking to shades of brown for the color scheme, etc. I made a checklist to begin organizing how I would go about creating this sketch and included the main requirements as well as personal goals.

I tried completing the outer tracing of the entire face first using customizable vertices and then built up on it layer by layer - such as making rough traces of the face, adding eyes, mouth. Here is a picture of a sketch I made very early on to roughly gauge how the coordinates would pan out.

I decided to keep the sketch rough-looking since the paintings themselves have a very unpolished/freehand style to them. It was rather an issue for me to recreate the roughness of an actual painting since computer designs and graphics (in this case) were too predetermined to touch upon details like different brush strokes or textures. Even while drawing the skeleton of the face, my attempt at making things look devoid of structure still felt a bit orchestrated. 

I had to balance a thin line between writing code that emulated the significant styles of the painting and lengthening the file with inessential details. A simple retracing, for instance, would take up many lines of code: since each of the face's coordinates were arbitrarily placed, I was not able to come up with a dynamic way of coding all the points relative to the face.

While constructing the teeth, I didnâ€™t opt for one of the objectives in my checklist since the teeth themselves looked like a substantial addition instead of just lips. It was slightly tricky trying to place them individually using a for loop and multiple variables.
